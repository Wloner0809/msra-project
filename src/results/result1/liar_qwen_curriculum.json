Assess the statement with a fine-grained approach:\n\n1. **Fact-Check Rigorously**: Verify the core claims made in the statement against reliable sources. A statement is considered deliberately deceptive if it contains facts that are proven false with the clear intent to mislead, not just if it's factually incorrect due to oversight.\n\n2. **Examine Motives**: Analyze the speaker's possible motives. Deliberate deception often serves a specific agenda, such as gaining political advantage or diverting attention.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**: Evaluate the context in which the statement was made. Inaccuracies in a commentary or political speech may be spin rather than deception if the broader context shows they were not meant to mislead.\n\n4. **Differentiate Between Errors**: Distinguish between intentional deception and honest mistakes, exaggeration, or misinterpretation. Pay attention to the pattern of statements—repeated inaccuracies can signal deception.\n\n5. **Evaluate Political Environment**: Consider the political landscape. Statements that align with party lines but are factually wrong might be spin, but if they're intentionally misleading in the context, that's deception.\n\nExample 1 (Revised Prompt Application):\nText: \"Statement: Gains in Atlanta Public Schools scores on a national standardized test lend credence to dramatic score increases on state tests.\"\nAnalysis: Look for actual data on Atlanta Public Schools' scores, comparing national and state tests. If there's no factual basis for the correlation claimed and the speaker knows this, it's deception.\n\nExample 2 (Revised Prompt Application):\nText: \"Statement: Paul Workman wants to raise the sales tax.\"\nCheck the record for Paul Workman's position on sales tax. If he never expressed this intent and the claim is made to sway public opinion, it indicates deliberate deception.\n\nExample 3 (Revised Prompt Application):\nText: \"Statement: U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on whether Senate Democrats would seat Roland Burris.\"\nAnalyze if Harry Reid's statement contradicts known actions or intentions, with the aim to misinform.\n\nExample 4 (Revised Prompt Application):\nText: \"Statement: 'I actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before (Obama) did.'\"\nVerify the timeline of the speaker's and Obama's public statements on Iraq to assess if this is a false claim made to enhance their political image.\n\nRemember, the goal is to identify intent behind the discrepancy, not just the discrepancy itself.\n\n# Output format\nAnswer Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:",
