The original instruction asks if the given statement is hate speech and asks the respondent to provide reasons for their answer. The revised instruction uses more concise language and omits unnecessary words. Instead of asking if the statement is hate speech, it asks the respondent to determine whether it constitutes hate speech.

This approach allows for a more nuanced evaluation of the statement, taking into account the language used, the broader social and cultural context, and the potential impact on marginalized groups. By avoiding the use of the term "hate speech," the instruction also avoids potential controversy or disagreement around the definition and interpretation of hate speech.\n\n# Output format\nAnswer Yes or No as labels\n\n# Prediction\nText: {{ text }}\nLabel:')
